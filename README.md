I’m thrilled to share that I have successfully completed Task 1 of my web development internship at Prodigy Info Tech! This experience has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience in web development.
I’m looking forward to continuing this journey and sharing more updates along the way. Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far!
